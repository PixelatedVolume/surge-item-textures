VORTEX SPECIAL ITEMS - DEFAULT
By PixelatedVolume
dist. 2023/02/01

This is a resource pack providing special textures for "Vortex" 
PVP items used on the Lord of the Craft (LotC), a medieval-
fantasy roleplay server.  It requires Custom Item Textures (CIT) 
to work, which is distributed as part of Optifine (optifine.net).

Be aware all larger-than-standard models render too large in the 
inventory GUI.  A suitable solution will be implemented as soon 
as it is discovered.

This pack and all assets in it were created by PixelatedVolume,
